# Fluorence

## What is it?
Fluorence is a simple game engine written from scratch with OpenGL. It provides a barebone - basic functionality such as vertex array, vertex buffer, index buffer, and texture creation to 3D model loading (incomplete).

## Building
Like any other CMake project, create a build directory and call `cmake .. && cmake --build .` from there.

Currently I only support linux. For any other platforms... Unfortunately, it's on your own. I don't have a Windows / Mac machine to test this project because of many reason. But I think it should work on Windows / Linux.

## Example
You can take a look at the `Sandbox` subdirectory for reference on how to use this engine.
